2
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:46,437
Give him another go, Ned.

3
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,439
That's my father.

4
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:50,107
And my Uncle Benjen.

5
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:54,412
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

6
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:04,822
They were all so happy.

7
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:08,092
So were you once.

8
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:16,133
Stop showing off.

9
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,735
Lyanna!

10
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,203
My Aunt Lyanna.

11
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,705
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

12
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:26,110
My father never talked about her.

13
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:33,350
<i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

14
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:38,355
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

15
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:39,557
<i>I don't know.</i>

16
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,659
What about him?

17
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:45,362
Wylis, come here.

18
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:51,702
Hodor?

19
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,471
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

20
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:57,308
And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

21
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,844
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

22
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:03,514
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

23
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,150
Hodor talks?

24
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,424
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

25
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:16,160
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

26
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:18,462
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

27
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,498
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

28
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,502
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

29
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,403
So leave him be.

30
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:28,639
It is time to go.

31
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:31,375
Please, a little longer.

32
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:46,524
You finally show me
something I care about

33
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:47,858
and then you drag me away.

34
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,629
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

35
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,198
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

36
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,936
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

37
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:14,218
Wylis.

38
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,619
Hodor.

39
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,521
I saw you as a boy.

40
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,524
You could talk.

41
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:23,360
What happened?

42
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:25,529
Hodor.

43
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:31,502
Where's Meera?

44
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,606
Hodor.

45
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,700
You shouldn't be here.

46
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:05,636
It's not safe outside the cave.

47
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,938
It's not safe anywhere.

48
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,910
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

49
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:14,912
- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

50
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:20,251
And he could talk and
fight and-- and then--

51
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,519
What's wrong?

52
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,791
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

53
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,861
And we're going to fight it in there?

54
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,526
Brandon Stark needs you.

55
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,363
For what?
I sit in there

56
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:09,033
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

57
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,869
He isn't going to stay here forever.

58
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,073
And out there he needs you.

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,967
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

60
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,537
Open the door and the men inside

61
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:49,640
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

62
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:59,683
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

63
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:05,389
Nobody needs to die tonight.

64
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,428
I've never been much of a fighter.

65
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,704
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

66
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,713
Come on.

67
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,661
Attack!

68
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,971
Fight, you cowards!

69
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,605
You fucking traitor.

70
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,240
The only traitors here are the ones

71
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:06,777
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

72
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,147
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

73
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,650
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

74
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,752
Until you.

75
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:28,999
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

76
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:04,101
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

77
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:09,907
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

78
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,743
Bodies to burn.

79
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:22,653
<i> Shh, hey.</i>

80
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:26,590
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

81
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:28,859
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

82
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:31,828
All of a sudden she looks my way.

83
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,798
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

84
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,034
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

85
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,836
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

86
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:42,773
She's never seen anything like it.

87
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,342
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

88
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:48,345
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

89
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,212
Ooh!

90
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:54,151
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

91
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,353
Well, you all know me.

92
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:59,022
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

93
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,068
Get out of my way.

94
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,871
King's orders, Your Grace.

95
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,408
What are the king's orders?

96
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,011
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

97
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:29,946
for your own protection.

98
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,083
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

99
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:38,755
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

100
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:41,425
I would like to speak to my son.

101
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:44,928
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

102
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,927
She grew up.

103
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,395
<i>Almost.</i>

104
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:22,165
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

105
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:26,002
I expect it was Mother.

106
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:28,271
Your mother wouldn't do that.

107
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:30,173
Yes, she would.

108
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:34,277
Are you angry with her?

109
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,748
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

110
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,150
She has every right to be here.

111
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:44,254
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

112
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:49,526
If she had tried--
They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.

113
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:52,162
Not while I'm here.

114
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:57,167
Why haven't you gone to see her?

115
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:02,506
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

116
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:05,776
Don't you think I know that?

117
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:11,381
I'm sorry.

118
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,051
But I can't.

119
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,820
Why not?

120
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,291
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

121
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:23,794
what did I do?

122
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,532
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

123
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:30,934
what did I do?

124
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:33,270
We all fail sometimes.

125
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:36,540
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

126
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:41,011
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

127
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,212
what good am I?

128
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:46,316
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

129
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:50,487
Your Grace.

130
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:52,289
Lord Commander.

131
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,991
I want to see my wife.

132
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:57,127
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

133
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:01,031
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

134
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:04,000
The king must wait as well.

135
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:07,170
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

136
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:19,182
You're a bold man.

137
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,285
On the contrary.

138
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,955
I fear a great deal.

139
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:28,358
The Father, the Mother,

140
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,027
the Warrior.

141
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:44,140
Do you know why we use these stones?

142
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,377
To remind us not to fear death.

143
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:51,281
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

144
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:54,384
You must long for the next life.

145
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,087
In truth, I fear that, too.

146
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,190
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

147
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:03,159
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

148
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:05,128
and atoned for her sin.

149
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,964
What about my sins?

150
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:13,603
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

151
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,207
I killed my own cousin.

152
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,276
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

153
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:22,412
I helped him escape their justice.

154
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:26,616
What atonement do I deserve?

155
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:30,687
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

156
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,622
Oh, the gods won't mind.

157
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:36,393
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

158
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:39,996
Go on, then.

159
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:43,500
I deserve it.
We all do.

160
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:46,202
We are weak, vain creatures.

161
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:49,472
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

162
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:08,024
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

163
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,292
I don't.

164
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:12,495
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

165
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,264
I've fought against worse odds.

166
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:17,500
No doubt many of us would fall.

167
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:20,470
But who are we, hmm?

168
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:23,139
We have no names, no family.

169
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:27,477
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

170
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,713
And yet together,

171
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:33,249
we can overthrow an empire.

172
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:05,181
<i>Mother.</i>

173
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:19,496
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

174
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,032
Gold.

175
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:25,335
Good. It was always her color.

176
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:30,774
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

177
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:35,578
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>

178
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:41,117
I didn't want to lose you again.

179
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,386
I understand.

180
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,390
I'm glad to see you.

181
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,462
I know I should have come sooner.

182
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:56,533
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

183
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:59,769
It's all right.

184
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:04,774
No, it isn't.

185
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,545
I should have executed all of them.

186
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,080
I should have pulled down the sept

187
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:14,684
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

188
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:17,720
as you would have for me.

189
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,458
You raised me to be strong...

190
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:25,261
and I wasn't.

191
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:28,631
But I want to be.

192
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,169
Help me.

193
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:39,209
Always.

194
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:10,140
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

195
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,578
Meaning no offense.

196
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,781
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

197
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,216
I do not make dwarf jokes.

198
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:22,352
You think them.

199
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:25,922
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

200
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:30,426
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

201
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,762
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

202
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:36,332
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

203
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:39,169
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

204
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:40,937
The Masters have retaken both cities.

205
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:47,277
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

206
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:52,715
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

207
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:53,917
They are not eating.

208
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,353
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

209
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:59,622
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

210
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:02,492
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

211
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:06,362
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

212
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:08,531
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

213
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:11,367
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

214
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,938
I drink and I know things.

215
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:19,509
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

216
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:22,245
ranged over hundreds of miles.

217
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:23,846
Then Daenerys's ancestors

218
00:22:23,848 --> 00:22:26,983
started chaining them up in pens.

219
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:28,751
A few generations later,

220
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:32,522
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

221
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:36,526
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

222
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:38,828
Missandei,

223
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,632
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

224
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:47,270
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

225
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,938
Never.

226
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,673
Dragons are intelligent.

227
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:53,910
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

228
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:56,546
They have affection for their friends

229
00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:59,015
and fury for their enemies.

230
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:02,352
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

231
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:06,489
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

232
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,449
I'm friends with your mother.

233
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,391
I'm here to help.

234
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:50,993
Don't eat the help.

235
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:56,632
When I was a child,

236
00:24:56,634 --> 00:25:00,703
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

237
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:02,805
I begged him for one of you.

238
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:07,643
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

239
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:11,714
"It could be little
like me."

240
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:22,592
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

241
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:25,395
Then my father told me

242
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:29,399
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

243
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:33,403
I cried myself to sleep that night.

244
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,414
But here you are.

245
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,916
Next time I have an idea like that,

246
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:56,252
punch me in the face.

247
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,767
What's your name?

248
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:19,909
What's your name?

249
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:23,513
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

250
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:26,749
You don't believe that.

251
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:00,550
Who are you?

252
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:02,552
No one.

253
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:04,720
If a girl says her name,

254
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:08,157
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

255
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,626
A girl has no name.

256
00:28:10,628 --> 00:28:12,828
If a girl says her name,

257
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,097
a man will feed her tonight.

258
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,100
A girl has no name.

259
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,636
If a girl says her name,

260
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,706
a man will give her eyes back.

261
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:27,710
A girl has no name.

262
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:37,286
Come.

263
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:46,862
Leave it.

264
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:50,199
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

265
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:02,044
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

266
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,082
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

267
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:07,283
They obviously had help.

268
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:11,354
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

269
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:14,323
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

270
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:16,792
We know where she's going.

271
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:18,694
Her brother's at Castle Black.

272
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:20,296
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

273
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:22,865
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

274
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,401
So was I, Father.

275
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:27,703
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

276
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,939
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

277
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:32,274
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

278
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:36,278
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

279
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,783
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow--

280
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:43,786
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

281
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:47,423
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

282
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:50,192
We don't need
every house in the North.

283
00:29:50,194 --> 00:29:52,862
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

284
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:56,999
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

285
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,435
With their support,
none could challenge us.

286
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:04,240
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

287
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:08,144
It's time for new blood in the North.

288
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:19,221
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

289
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,856
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

290
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:24,894
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

291
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:27,363
<i>My lords.</i>

292
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:30,266
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

293
00:30:30,268 --> 00:30:32,034
A boy.

294
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:34,403
<i>Red-cheeked
and healthy.</i>

295
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:38,474
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

296
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,752
Congratulations, Father.

297
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:53,956
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

298
00:30:57,462 --> 00:31:00,863
You'll always be my firstborn.

299
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:03,933
Thank you for saying that.

300
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:06,936
It means a great deal to me.

301
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,306
Maester Wolkan,

302
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:49,512
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

303
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:53,382
Poisoned by our enemies.

304
00:31:59,257 --> 00:32:01,891
How did he die?

305
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:07,296
Poisoned by his enemies.

306
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:11,167
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

307
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:14,370
Forgive me, my lord.

308
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:19,542
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

309
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:23,212
She's resting, my lord.

310
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,551
At once, my lord.

311
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:55,044
There he is.

312
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:57,479
Isn't he wonderful?

313
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:03,052
May I hold him?

314
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:06,388
Of-- of course.

315
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,400
Little brother.

316
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,103
Lord Bolton sent for us.

317
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:23,239
Have you seen him?

318
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:35,050
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

319
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:54,403
Where is Lord Bolton?

320
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:05,247
Down!

321
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:08,417
<i> It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

322
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:13,055
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

323
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:22,264
Ramsay, where is your father?

324
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:25,267
Ramsay.

325
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,277
Where is Lord Bolton?

326
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:43,953
I am Lord Bolton.

327
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:55,431
Ramsay.

328
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,498
Ramsay, please.

329
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,369
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

330
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:07,443
Please.

331
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:09,745
Ramsay.

332
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:13,515
He's your brother.

333
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,487
I prefer being an only child.

334
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:41,577
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

335
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,045
I don't think he hurt her.

336
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:47,383
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

337
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:50,519
You don't know which way she went?

338
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:53,288
I spent three days looking for her.

339
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,290
She disappeared.

340
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,627
How'd she look?

341
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:00,496
She looked good.

342
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:04,433
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

343
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,469
No, she wouldn't be.

344
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:11,540
What happened at Winterfell?

345
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:26,155
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

346
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:29,792
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

347
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,632
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

348
00:36:56,387 --> 00:36:59,088
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

349
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,855
It's not safe.

350
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:01,223
He won't stop hunting us.

351
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:02,658
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

352
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,227
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

353
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:08,797
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

354
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:10,199
I won't let him.

355
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,202
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

356
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:17,206
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

357
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:21,844
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

358
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:26,849
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

359
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:30,719
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

360
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:33,355
I don't want to be forgiven.

361
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,259
I can never make
amends to your family

362
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,428
for the things I've done.

363
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:43,732
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

364
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:51,206
You're not coming with us?

365
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:56,578
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

366
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,648
I would have died to get you there.

367
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,834
May I take one of the horses?

368
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:24,640
Where will you go?

369
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:29,378
Home.

370
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:41,456
<i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

371
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,692
And the ironborn who held it?

372
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:47,696
They died fighting to a man.

373
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,799
What is dead may never die.

374
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,468
What is dead may never die.

375
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,270
But they did

376
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:57,506
and our invasion died with them.

377
00:38:57,508 --> 00:39:01,376
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

378
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:02,778
Then we will take more.

379
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,915
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

380
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:10,852
Because I order it.

381
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:12,788
We can defeat anyone at sea,

382
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,490
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

383
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:16,692
against mainland armies.

384
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:18,594
Not if our captains defy my orders,

385
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:23,498
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

386
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,235
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

387
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:27,302
Then where is he?

388
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:28,937
Where is your kingdom?

389
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:33,909
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

390
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,677
That war is over.

391
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,412
The last time
we provoked them too far,

392
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:40,515
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

393
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:42,517
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

394
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,653
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

395
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:47,856
And I lost three sons.

396
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:50,492
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

397
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:51,727
Well, the other four are dead.

398
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:55,697
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

399
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:57,633
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

400
00:39:57,635 --> 00:40:01,336
or I will make another heir who will.

401
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,843
Let me pass.

402
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:47,683
You fool, move aside for your king.

403
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,652
Haven't I always, brother?

404
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:04,099
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

405
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:08,403
What is dead may never die.

406
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,607
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

407
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:14,943
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

408
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:18,380
You can mock our god without my help.

409
00:41:18,382 --> 00:41:21,416
I don't mock the Drowned God.

410
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:24,419
I am the Drowned God.

411
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:26,021
From Oldtown to Qarth,

412
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:29,991
when men see my sails, they pray.

413
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:42,137
You're old, brother.

414
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:44,106
<i>You've had your time.</i>

415
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:46,508
Now let another rule.

416
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,678
I heard you lost your mind

417
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,147
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

418
00:41:52,149 --> 00:41:58,720
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

419
00:41:58,722 --> 00:41:59,654
They did.

420
00:41:59,656 --> 00:42:04,860
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

421
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:07,429
I needed silence.

422
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:10,031
What kind of an ironborn

423
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:14,436
loses his senses during a storm?

424
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:18,039
I am the storm, brother.

425
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,143
The first storm and the last.

426
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:24,780
And you're in my way.

427
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:06,154
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

428
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:09,891
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

429
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:11,793
Pull his bones down to your depths

430
00:43:11,795 --> 00:43:14,896
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

431
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:18,066
What is dead may never die.

432
00:43:26,477 --> 00:43:28,777
I'm going to find out who did this.

433
00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:32,981
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

434
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:36,585
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

435
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:39,688
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

436
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,756
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

437
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:43,225
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

438
00:43:43,227 --> 00:43:47,896
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

439
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:50,932
Perhaps you'll win.

440
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:55,704
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

441
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,740
And perhaps not.

442
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:17,225
Come in.

443
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:26,601
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

444
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:29,204
You interrupt nothing.

445
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:44,085
I assume you know why I'm here.

446
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:46,154
I will after you tell me.

447
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:48,657
It's about the Lord Commander.

448
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:51,593
The former Lord Commander.

449
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:54,696
Does he have to be?

450
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:00,268
What are you asking?

451
00:45:03,574 --> 00:45:08,043
Do you know of any magic...

452
00:45:09,146 --> 00:45:10,946
that could help him?

453
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:12,013
Bring him back?

454
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:15,116
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

455
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:17,085
Can it be done?

456
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,888
There are some with this power.

457
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,691
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

458
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:24,259
Have you seen it done?

459
00:45:26,663 --> 00:45:29,364
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

460
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:32,367
but the priest
who did it--

461
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:34,636
it shouldn't have been possible.

462
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:38,106
But it was.
It could be now.

463
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:40,942
Not for me.

464
00:45:44,748 --> 00:45:47,115
Not for you?

465
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:53,355
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

466
00:45:53,357 --> 00:45:57,125
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

467
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:59,628
Everything I believed,

468
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,331
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

469
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,667
all of it was a lie.

470
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:11,206
You were right all along.

471
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:14,242
The Lord never spoke to me.

472
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:16,244
Fuck him, then.

473
00:46:16,246 --> 00:46:18,847
Fuck all of them.

474
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:23,051
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

475
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:27,756
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

476
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:32,360
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

477
00:46:32,362 --> 00:46:38,133
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

478
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:41,870
I never had this gift.

479
00:46:41,872 --> 00:46:44,305
Have you ever tried?

480
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:29,964
Please.

481
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:28,939
